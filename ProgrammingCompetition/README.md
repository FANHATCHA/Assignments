**Algorithms to add:**
- [ ] Given a line and a point, find the closest point on the line to the point (Try this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/849211/shortest-distance-between-a-point-and-a-line-segment) (formula to find the distance here: http://www.intmath.com/plane-analytic-geometry/perpendicular-distance-point-line.php)
- [ ] Given two circles, find the intersection points of those circles
- [x] Given a directed graph, find all sets of strongly connected components
- [ ] Given a directed, acyclic graph, do a topological sort
- [x] Given three points find the center of a circle (two points does not give a unique center)
- [ ] Given a weighted complete graph, find the minimum perfect matching
- [x] Get equation for Incenter
- [x] Get equation for Inradius
- [ ] Find the number of paths from A to B of length n in a graph (NOTE: This can be done efficiently using matrix multiplication).
- [ ] Bellman-Ford - Complexity: O(V Ã— E), works on negative weights, can be used to detect negative-weight cycles.
