Formally also known as the central polygonal numbers, it describes the maximum number of pieces (or bounded/unbounded regions) of a circle (a pancake or pizza is usually used to describe the situation) that can be made with a given number of straight cuts. For example, three cuts across a pancake will produce six pieces if the cuts all meet at a common point, but seven if they do not.

* Trianglar:
```0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55...```

* Hexagonal:
```1, 6, 15, 28, 45, 66, 91, 120, 153, 190, 231...```

* Subfactorial denoted !n represents a lot of common patterns, notably the number of ways elements can be
* arranged such that each element is not found in it's starting position.

``` 0 1 2 9 44 265 1854 14833 ... ```
