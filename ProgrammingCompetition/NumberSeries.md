* Lazy Caterer:
```1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22, 29, 37, 46, 56, 67, 79, 92, 106, 121, 137, 154, 172, 191, 211...```

Formally also known as the central polygonal numbers, it describes the maximum number of pieces (or bounded/unbounded regions) of a circle (a pancake or pizza is usually used to describe the situation) that can be made with a given number of straight cuts. For example, three cuts across a pancake will produce six pieces if the cuts all meet at a common point, but seven if they do not.

* Subfactorial denoted !n represents a lot of common patterns, notably the number of ways elements can be
* arranged such that each element is not found in it's starting position.
