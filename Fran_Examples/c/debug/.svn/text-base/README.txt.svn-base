This directory contains some BROKEN C programs -- the purpose is to give
you a chance to try out the debugger.  There are three problems in
this program:

	- a dereference of a NULL pointer

	- an array that is indexed too far

	- a structure that is allocated based on the wrong size

	- a routine that has an invalid index


Comments in the program will help you understand these.
