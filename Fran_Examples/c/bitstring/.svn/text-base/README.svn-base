The file simplebitstring.c loads up a newly allocated bitstring with
some hardcoded values from memory, and then prints them out.

The file flagstorage.c is an example that creates a bitstring of a
fixed length filled with random values.  String is saved to
<file>bit.txt and <file>int.txt to allow examination of the required
size in memory.
