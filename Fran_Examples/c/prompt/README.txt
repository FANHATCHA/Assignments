This example shows reading standard input in a loop, and optionally printing
a prompt if input is from a terminal.  For more terminal tricks, look at the
examples in the "ioctl" directory.

Try running this example at a prompt, and typing in some values.

Also, try running this example from a pipe, as shown here:
	cat testdata.txt | ./readlines

As you can see, this prevents the prompts from appearing.
